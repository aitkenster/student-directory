student-directory
=================

This was our first project during weeks 1 and 2 of Makers Academy. Pairing with a mix of other students on the course, I created an interactive directory which could hold information about all of the students on the course. It has the following features:

List of all students
Ordered by name
Grouped by cohort (as an exercise)
Adds new students by asking the user to input the names
Show information about a given student
Add information related to a particular student (e.g. hobbies)
Has an interactive menu to ask the user what he or she would like to do
Displays information about the number of records in the directory
Saves data to a file
Loads data from a the file

This was my first introduction to Ruby and RSPEC. If I was to spend some more time on the project, I would implement a student class, and split the directoy-TDD.rb file into smaller componenets, so it would be more readable.
